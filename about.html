<p><b> My name is Renata.</b> </p>
<p>I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in March 2022.</p>
<p>I tried telephone support, online support groups, and chat support groups, but nothing worked for me. I prefer to be in the same room with the people I am talking to. I find in-person groups can be less distracting, and offer an excuse to get out of our houses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 restrictions, in-person groups are still not an option, at the end of 2024.</p>

<p>When I participated in the <i><strong>"LiveStrong® at the YMCA"</strong></i> program, together with my mates, we started to meet every month for lunch.</br>
Our lunches became something to look forward to, because they were a great opportunity to talk with someone who could really understand what we are going through.</p> 
<p>With time, the group started growing, involving the people participating in the following sessions of the <i><strong>"LiveStrong® at the YMCA"</strong></i> program. 
</p> 

<p>Also, being myself an employee of the Kenosha YMCA, I got in touch with other people dealing with cancer's side effects. By talking with them, I realized that I am able to offer them support, comfort, and empathy. That’s when I had the idea to create an in-person support group for people who have or have had cancer and that can benefit from the group.</p>
<p>I understand that Covid-19 scared us, but, after five years, it is now time to put <strong>patients' needs first</strong>. <br>
Nobody wants to be a member of the <i><strong>cancer patients community</strong></i>; however, as we have been forced into this community, we better help each other.</p>
<p>I started thinking about what I can and cannot offer, then I found a name to identify this particular group.</p>
<p>The name <i><strong>Waves of Resilience</strong></i> represents the perseverance required on this special journey.</br> 
The <strong>waves</strong> represent the ups and downs of our mood and our body strength; <strong>resilience</strong> represent the new life of a cancer patient. </p>
<p>After I noted down ideas about what I can and cannot offer, and then the name, I was looking for a place that was quiet, private, and also free, because I don't want to ask for any money. A friend suggested the library and the Southwest Neighborhood Library in Kenosha is the one that offers several rooms with different capacity. I went to talk with someone there to see if that was an option and I reserved the room.</p>

<p>At this point, the only thing missing was a logo. For this, as well as for the name, I worked with my husband.<br>
I wanted the waves, of course, but also a sun representing a new day, a new life rising after the storm. As a final touch we added a hand offering a little plant, like a hand offering help, support, and empathy.
</p>
<p>And here we are, with this project that I honestly hope will be a success.
